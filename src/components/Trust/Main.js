                                We take our responsibility as Kickstarter's stewards very seriously. It's our job to provide a system deserving of your trust — by proactively screening for potential problems, by investigating issues brought to us by our community, and by still being exceedingly clear that even with these steps not every project will go as planned.
    
                                Our goal is to provide a safe and trusted platform where people are honest and open with one another as they collaborate to bring creative projects to life.

Don't forget to read the comments (to see what others are saying) and any updates (to see how the creator communicates with backers). The "Risks and Challenges" section is especially worth a look.                            </p>

Do people say good things about them? If you're curious about the thing they're creating, you can look into that, too. Has it been tried before? What happened then?
